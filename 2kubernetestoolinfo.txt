There are multiple tools to install a kubernetes cluster. minikube and docker client=>local installs and its a single(one-node) cluster(for development,testing and not for production). For production cluster=>Kops and kubeadm are tools to spin up a production cluster.On AWS, the best tools is kops.

At some point AWS EKS, the host of Kubernetes,

will also be available.

At that point this will probably be the preferred option.

With the hosted solution you don't

need to maintain the masters.

With kops you own all the infrastructure

so you also need to maintain a masters.

For other installs, or if you cannot get kops to work,

you can use kubeadm.

Kubeadm is an alternative approach,

and kops is still recommended on AWS.

You also have AWS integrations with kops automatically.

Kubeadm is a more generic tool.

So it's an alternative approach if you're not on AWS

or if you cannot get it working,

but I still recommend you to use lops of you are on AWS

because you will get integrations

with IAM and a load balancer as well.

The kubeadm lectures can be found at the end of this course,

and let you spin up a cluster on DigitalOcean.

Because the focus on this course is really

on minikube and kops I just put the lectures at the end

because they provide you an alternative way

of setting of a cluster.

If you have AWS you should always try AWS first.

If you're going to do bare metal or another cloud provider

then kubeadm can be a good alternative.
